        text: 'Software tools allow us to automatically print out bill of materials from 3D models. We use barcode tracking of individual pieces to make sharing different machines even easier. In addition to classic woodworking machines, we have three modern computer-controlled CNC machines that enable the production of more complex elements and details. Before transport, the finished products are packed with quality using a packaging machine.'
